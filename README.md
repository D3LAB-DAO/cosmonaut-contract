## How to Run
```shell
./run.sh user lesson_num
```

i.g)
```shell
./run.sh user1 1
```

1. Create or copy&paste user customized contract into {user}/contracts
2. In order to increase compilation speed, copy&paste debug directory which is made based on same architecture as rust's base image
   * target directory of user1(user1/targets/lesson/debug) is an example

*** IMPORTANT: you must pass lesson number ***
